# logoGenerator
A generator to generate a generic logo

10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.
